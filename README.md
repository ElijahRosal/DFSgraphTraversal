## Files
- `Prog1.java` – Main class that reads input and runs the program.
- `Graph.java` – Represents an undirected graph and finds connected components.
- `GraphTraversal.java` – Utility class for parsing and processing graphs.

## How to Compile
Open a terminal and navigate to the program's directory. Then, run:
```bash
javac Graph.java GraphTraversal.java Prog1.java
```
## How to Run
```bash
java Prog1 <your_filename>.txt
